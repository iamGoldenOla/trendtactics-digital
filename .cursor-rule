# Cursor Rules for Trendtactics Digital

## Project Overview
This is a digital marketing and web development project for TrendtacticsDigital.com — governs all web development practices, layout systems, UX/UI strategy, AI agent interaction, email handling, and deployment standards.

**Auto Attachments**: `/pages/`, `/components/`, `/utils/`, `/styles/`, `/data/`, `/images/`

## Core Project Rules

### 🌐 Project Purpose
Build a cinematic, intelligent, and scalable digital marketing website for TrendtacticsDigital.com, fully connected to TrendyAI internal agents, including LMS, admin dashboard, pricing, quiz, ebook hub, blog, and smart tools.

### 🎨 Layout & Design
Use Z-pattern, Split Grid, or Bento layouts based on context. Homepage uses a Split Hero Video layout with Framer Motion. All pages must use layered background gradients and contrast sections for clarity.

### 🎬 Hero Section Standards (Per Page)
Homepage uses a cinematic split-screen video hero. Other pages use static image-based heroes with headline, subtext, and CTA overlay. All hero sections must be between 65vh–80vh.

### 🧑‍💼 Pages Structure
Follow this page structure: Homepage, About Us, Services (with subcategories), Pricing, Blog, Ebook, Portfolio, LMS (Academy), Client Quiz, Contact, Admin Dashboard, Smart Tools Hub.

### 📩 Email & ClientFlow Integration
All forms must do two things: 1) Send email to info@trendtacticsdigital.com using Nodemailer or Formspree, and 2) Trigger ClientFlow agent on TrendyAI.com via POST to /api/agents/clientFlow with validated JSON payloads.

### 📋 Functionality
Must support mobile-first responsive layout, SEO optimization (meta, OG, sitemap), Google/Meta/LinkedIn analytics, form validation, alt text, lazy loading, dark mode toggle, and quiz/ebook/form integration with ClientFlow.

### 🧑‍💻 Development Stack
Use HTML5, TailwindCSS, JavaScript ES6+, and React. Optionally use Node.js for backend (API routes). Follow naming conventions: camelCase (functions), PascalCase (components), kebab-case (files/folders).

### 📂 Folder Structure
Organize code into: `/pages/`, `/components/`, `/utils/`, `/styles/`, `/data/`, `/images/`. Admin routes under `/admin`. LMS content under `/academy`.

### 🧠 Admin & LMS
Admin dashboard must control blog, pricing, ebooks, and LMS uploads. LMS supports paywall, video lessons, PDF tasks, and student dashboard.

### 📈 Deployment & Source Control
Integrate with GitHub for version control. Recommend deployment on Cursor, Vercel, Netlify or cPanel after full testing and pixel perfection.

### 🛑 Forbidden Practices
Avoid lorem ipsum, fake reviews, full-video background, dense overlapping text, poor accessibility, sound autoplay, and visual clutter.

# 📦 CURSOR SETUP GUIDE: EMAIL + CLIENTFLOW

## 👉 FOLLOW THESE STEPS INSIDE CURSOR TO CONNECT FORMS, EMAILS, AND AI AUTOMATION

### ✅ STEP 1: Create API Handler File

**📁 Path**: `/pages/api/send.js`

```javascript
import nodemailer from "nodemailer";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  if (req.method !== "POST") return res.status(405).send("Only POST allowed");

  const { name, email, message, source } = req.body;

  // 1. Email to Admin
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
    host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,
    auth: {
      user: process.env.SMTP_USER,
      pass: process.env.SMTP_PASS,
    },
  });

  await transporter.sendMail({
    from: process.env.SMTP_USER,
    to: process.env.ADMIN_EMAIL,
    subject: `[New Lead] ${source}`,
    html: `<p><b>Name:</b> ${name}</p><p><b>Email:</b> ${email}</p><p>${message}</p>`,
  });

  // 2. Trigger ClientFlow AI Agent
  await fetch("https://trendyai.com/api/agents/clientFlow", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      type: "lead",
      source,
      name,
      email,
      message,
    }),
  });

  res.status(200).json({ success: true });
}
```

### ✅ STEP 2: Create Your .env File

**📁 Path**: `/yourproject/.env`

```env
SMTP_USER=your_email@domain.com
SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
SMTP_HOST=smtp.zoho.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=info@trendtacticsdigital.com
```

### ✅ STEP 3: Connect Your Frontend Forms

Use this format on any page (Contact, Quiz, Ebook, etc.):

```html
<form method="POST" action="/api/send">    
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Full name" required />    
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email address" required />    
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your message or inquiry"></textarea>    
  <input type="hidden" name="source" value="contact_form" />    
  <button type="submit">Send Message</button>    
</form>
```

**🧠 NOTE**: Replace `source="contact_form"` with `"quiz_form"`, `"pricing_form"` or `"ebook_form"` depending on page.

### ✅ FINAL CHECKLIST:

- [ ] Add `/pages/api/send.js`
- [ ] Add `.env` file
- [ ] Use proper forms on relevant pages
- [ ] Test email send + ClientFlow trigger
- [ ] Never expose passwords in frontend

---

## 📦 Done correctly, Cursor will:

- 💬 Send new leads to your email
- 🤖 Trigger AI follow-up via ClientFlow
- 📊 Help track form interactions in analytics
- 🧠 Use this .cursor-rules as its full dev brain

---

## 🔄 NEXT STEP: Upload This File into Cursor

1. Save your full `.cursor-rules` file (including this block at the end)
2. Upload it directly to your Cursor project root

**That's it. Cursor will now:**
- Read all build rules
- Set up your hero layouts
- Include email + AI logic
- Provide backend instructions to devs

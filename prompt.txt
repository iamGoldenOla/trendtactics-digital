## 🤖 AI AGENT INTEGRATION (CLIENTFLOW)

ClientFlow (TrendyAI.com) handles:
- Lead tracking

- All form submissions (quiz, contact, pricing) must send data here

API POST: https://trendyai.com/api/agents/clientFlow  
Payload example:
```json
{
  "type": "lead",
  "source": "contact_form",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "message": "Interested in Growth Package"
}
```

## ✉️ EMAIL INTEGRATION

Each form must do BOTH:
1. ✅ Send admin email (e.g., info@trendtacticsdigital.com)
2. ✅ Trigger ClientFlow AI API

Option A (No-Code): Formspree  
```html
<form action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_CODE" method="POST">...</form>
```

.env config:
```env
SMTP_USER=info@trendtacticsdigital.com  
SMTP_PASS=YourAppPassword  
SMTP_HOST=smtp.zoho.com (or smtp.gmail.com)  
SMTP_PORT=465  
SMTP_SECURE=true  
```

Best Practices:
- Validate input fields
- Use `aria-label`s
